## ðŸŒŸ Tips / Best Practices:
- Naming Functions: Name functions in a clear way that indicates to the end user what the function is used for. 
- Variable Names: Name variables/inputs to the function clearly so the end user knows what each variable is.
- Type Hints: Type hints are useful so we know which type the variable should be before we use the function.
