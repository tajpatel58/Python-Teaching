# Python Exercise List 7:

### Task 1:
- Create a string and then use the len function on it: what does this output?
- Write a function that takes in a string, and outputs "even" if the length of the string is even, and "odd" if the length of the string is odd. 

        Inputs: 
            String: "Hello"
        
        Output: 
            String: "odd"

### Task 2:
- Write a function that takes a list of words (as strings) and returns a new list with all the words that have an even number of letters in them. 

        Inputs: 
            List: ["Hello", "My", "Name"]
        
        Output: 
            List: ["My", "Name"]

### Task 3:
- Write a function that takes in a list and finds the smallest number in the list

        Inputs: 
            List: [1,2,3,4,5]
        
        Output: 
            Float: 1
