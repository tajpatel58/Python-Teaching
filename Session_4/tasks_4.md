# Python Exercise List 3:


### Task 1:
- Create a list, try to use indexing to reassign the value of an element in the list. 
- Write a function that takes in 1 list of characters (length 1 strings), 1 item to look for, and 1 item to replace with, then return the list of characters, but replacing the item to look for with the item to replace.

        Inputs: 
            List: ['a', 'b', 'c'], 
            String to look for: 'b', 
            String to replace with: 'd'.
        
        Output: 
            list: ['a', 'd', 'c']


### Task 2:
- Write a function that takes in 1 string with only letters, and returns the number of vowels, and the number of consonants. 

        Inputs: 
            str: "Hello"
        
        Output:
            tuple: 2,3


### Task 3:
- Check session_2 notebook at the end to revise dictionaries.
- Search and test out some common dictionary methods, in particular make sure you understand: ".items", ".keys", ".values" 
- Write a function that takes in a dictionary and returns the dictionary reversed, ie: the keys of the input dictionary, become the values of the output dictionary and the values of the input dictionary, become the keys of the output dictionary. 

        Inputs: 
            dict: {"Taj" : 26, "Radhika" : 27}
        
        Output: 
            dict: {26: "Taj", : 27: "Radhika"}



### Task 4:
- Write a function that takes in a list of numbers, and returns a dictionary with keys being the unqiue values in the list, and the values being the count of the key in the list. 


        Inputs:
            list: [1,2,3,3,3,3,2,2,4,4,6]
        Output:
            dict: {1 : 1, 2: 3, 3: 4, 4: 2, 6: 1}


### Task 5:
- Write a function that given a string consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

        Inputs:
            str: "Hello Python is awesome"
        Output:
            int: 7

### Task 6: 
- Write a function that takes in a list of numbers, where each number is repeated atleast once, apart from one number that appears only once. Return the number that appears once. 

        Inputs: 
            list: [1,2,3,4,1,2,3]
        
        Output:
            float: 4
